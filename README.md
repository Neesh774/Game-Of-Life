# Game-Of-Life for Swing
This is yet another version of Conway's Game of Life, except this time, it uses Java's Swing and AWT libraries to play the game in a new window!

## Usage
Simply run the main file, GameOfLife.java, and you'll see your grid along with two buttons. The play button will go to the next generation, and the refresh button will restart your grid. There is also a rules button and a settings button. The rules button will explain how the game works, and the settings button allows you to change the colors of your living and dead cells.

## Coming Soon
- Ability to play/pause your game
- Ability to change size of your gae
