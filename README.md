# Game-Of-Life-Terminal
This is simply a version of the Game of Life bot that you can run in your terminal instead of Discord.

## How to Play
Simply run the GameOfLife.java file and the game will give you your grid and tell you what your options are.

### Commands
- ``setdc <character>`` can be used to set the new dead cell character.
- ``setlc <character>`` can be used to set the new live cell character.
- ``size <new size>`` can be used to create the new size of your grid. It will refresh your current grid.
