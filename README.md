# Game-Of-Life for Swing
This is yet another version of Conway's Game of Life, except this time, it uses Java's Swing and AWT libraries to play the game in a new window!

## Usage
Simply run the main file, GameOfLife.java, and you'll see your grid along with two buttons. The play button will go to the next generation, and the refresh button will restart your grid.

## Coming Soon
